1. Go through the DESeq2 links.
2. From the shared transcript count matrix, pick these 6 columns and create a smaller matrix.
    - SEEM.WT.CTL1A
    - SEEM.WT.CTL2A 
    - SEEM.WT.CTL3A
    - SEDM.WT.CTL1A
    - SEDM.WT.CTL2A
    - SEDM.WT.CTL3A
3. Create a design matrix for the columns with SEEM as control and SEDM as treated.
4. Create a DESeq2 script to perform differential expression.
5. Run DESeq2 script
6. List out the differentially expressed transcripts.
